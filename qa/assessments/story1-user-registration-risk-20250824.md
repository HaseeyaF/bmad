- **Probability**: High (3) - Common attack vector for user registration
- **Impact**: High (3) - Could lead to account compromises
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement strong password policy (length, complexity, common password check)
  - Add rate limiting for registration attempts
  - Use secure password hashing (bcrypt/Argon2)
- **Testing Focus**: Password policy validation, hash verification, brute force prevention

## High Risks (Score: 6)

### 2. SEC-002: Email Validation Vulnerabilities

**Score: 6 (High)**
- **Probability**: Medium (2) - Common attack surface
- **Impact**: High (3) - Could enable account hijacking
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement proper email format validation
  - Add email verification flow
  - Prevent duplicate email registrations
- **Testing Focus**: Email validation rules, verification process, duplicate handling

### 3. DATA-001: User Data Storage Security

**Score: 6 (High)**
- **Probability**: Medium (2) - Database operations always carry risk
- **Impact**: High (3) - Involves PII storage

- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement proper token expiration
  - Secure token storage practices
  - Add token refresh mechanism
- **Testing Focus**: Token validation, expiration handling, refresh flows

## Low Risks (Score: 2-3)

### 6. TECH-001: Form Submission Reliability

**Score: 3 (Low)**
- **Probability**: Low (1) - Standard functionality
- **Impact**: Medium (2) - User friction
- **Mitigation**:
  - Add form validation feedback
  - Implement retry mechanism
  - Clear error messaging
- **Testing Focus**: Form submission flows, error handling

### 7. BUS-001: User Experience Impact

**Score: 2 (Low)**
- **Probability**: Low (1) - Basic registration flow
- **Impact**: Low (1) - Standard expectations
- **Mitigation**:
  - Clear validation messages
  - Progress indicators
  - Success/failure notifications
- **Testing Focus**: UX validation, accessibility testing

## Risk Distribution
