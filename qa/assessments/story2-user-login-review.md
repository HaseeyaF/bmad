## Conclusion

While the basic structure of the story is sound and test coverage is comprehensive, several critical aspects need attention before proceeding with implementation. The main focus should be on enhancing security requirements, defining performance criteria, and adding technical specifications.

The story should not proceed to development until:
1. Security requirements are fully specified
2. Performance criteria are defined
3. Technical specifications are complete
4. Error handling scenarios are detailed

Once these updates are made, the story will be well-positioned for successful implementation with proper quality assurance coverage.
